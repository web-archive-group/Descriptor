    "# Creating Network Graphs for the WALK Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to create visually attractive network graphs from the WALK partner Web Archives for the public to view and manipulate online. We would like to promote the use of web archives, but unfortunately, the datasets for these files are very large. Without some visual cues, it would be difficult to know what is going on inside them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Networks are one way among many to show what websites are mentioned in the web archives and how they link to each other. Hopefully, most of the technical details are covered for you.  I wanted you to be able to see the technical side of things, while at the same time being able to modify it if you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are using [git](https://www.github.com), you should be able to make as many changes as you want to this notebook without hurting the main repository.  So, feel free to play around as much as you want.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The code being used for this repository is R. R is optimised for conducting statistical analysis. Inside R are a number of libraries that can be installed.  A library is more code that has been built in such a way to be used by other programmers.  To access a library, we \"import\" the library.  In our case, the main libraries are iGraph, which is a tool for analyzing network graphs, and visNetwork which is a library for making attractive interactive network graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We install the libraries below.  In R code, putting a `#` in front of code means it is a comment.  Coders use comments for two main reasons.  1. To describe what is happening in code for other coders to read it.  2. To \"comment out\" code that is not being used currently, but might be used later.  When I want to use the code that is commented out, I will just simply remove the `#` and it will run as stated."
